F. Jackson's \textit{County and City of Cork Post Office General Directory, 1842--43} includes a ``William O'Brien, gent.''\ with a seat at ``Transtown mills'' and post town at ``Watergrass hill.''\citep{Jacksons} Land valuation records for Trantstown in 1847 and 1850 show a John O'Brien leasing a paper mill, house, offices (outbuildings), and land from Lady Augusta Henrietta Fitzgerald.\citep{Peramb1847,Peramb1850} A revised valuation in July 1850 indicates that John O'Brien no longer resided there, and that the mill became idle in 1847.\citep{House1850} Residents in Trantstown reported that a Mr.\ O'Brien owned the mill and employed many people there, but he sold his house when the mill closed down.\citep{PaperMill} The timing of John O'Brien's departure from the mill property around 1850 coincides with the arrival of William O'Brien's family in Boston.

There is no William O'Brien who appears in the valuation records as occupying land in Trantstown. It's possible that John O'Brien was William's son, and that he took over the running of the mill from his father.
