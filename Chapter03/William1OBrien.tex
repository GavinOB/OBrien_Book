\section{William O'Brien}

\ref{per:William1OBrien}.\ \MainPerson{William\textsuperscript{1} O'Brien} was born probably in County Cork, Ireland, about 1791.\cite{Census1855William} He died in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, 28 Dec 1856,\cite{William1OBrienDeath} and was buried at North Cambridge Catholic Cemetery, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.\cite{DianaBerberenaLetter} He married, likely in County Cork, \MainPerson{Mary Sexton}.\cite{Michael2OBrienDeath,Abigail2OBrienDeath,Ann2OBrienDeath,Mary2OBrienDeath} No further information about Mary is known.

William may be the William O'Brien listed in the 1842 Cork County Directory as owning Trantstown Mills, a paper mill close to the village of Watergrasshill.\cite{Jacksons}

In 1855, William was living in Boston with his son Edward, his daughter Abigail, and three of his grandchildren.\cite{Census1855William} William does not appear in the 1850 census. Since Edward immigrated to Boston in 1851\cite{Edward2OBrienNaturalization}, it's likely that William arrived with him at that time. William's wife Mary does not appear in any census records from this time. She may have died in Ireland before 1851, or not accompanied her husband to America for reasons unknown.

William only lived in Boston for five years before dying of pleurisy. He was living at 207 North Street in Boston's North End neighborhood at the time.\cite{William1OBrienDeath} William is buried in Cambridge, Mass., in a plot along with his infant granddaughter, Mary Ann O'Brien (daughter of son Edward).\cite{DianaBerberenaLetter}
