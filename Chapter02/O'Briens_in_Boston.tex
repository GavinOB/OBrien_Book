\chapter{The O'Briens in Boston}

The O'Briens\index{O'Brien!family} were among the almost 1.5 million Irish who sailed to the United States between 1845 and 1855.\cite{Miller:291} William\textsuperscript{1}'s\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} two youngest children, Michael\textsuperscript{2}\index{O'Brien!Michael\textsuperscript{2}} and Mary\textsuperscript{2},\index{O'Brien!Mary\textsuperscript{2}}\index{Ward!Mary\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)} were likely the first of the O'Brien family\index{O'Brien!family} to make the voyage. Irish families often could only afford tickets for one or two people, and so would choose the youngest and healthiest children.\cite{Miller:292} Once in America, the children would send remittances back to Ireland\index{Ireland} until the rest of the family could be brought over.\cite{Miller:295}

Ship passenger lists for the Port of New York\index{New York City} show a Mary O'Brien,\index{O'Brien!Mary\textsuperscript{2}}\index{Ward!Mary\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)} age 20, and Michael O'Brien,\index{O'Brien!Michael\textsuperscript{2}} age 15, arriving on the brig \textit{Thomas Baker}\index{Thomas Baker (ship)} from Galway, Ireland,\index{Ireland!Galway (city)} on 3 July 1849. There were 93 total passengers aboard. The occupation listed for everyone on the passenger manifest is ``farming.''\index{farming}\cite{ThomasBaker}

Brigs\index{Brigs} like the \textit{Thomas Baker}\index{Thomas Baker (ship)} were two-masted ships with square sails.\cite{OHanlon:35} Prior to the famine,\index{famine} these ships were outfitted for cargo rather than passengers.\cite{Laxton:9} The \textit{Thomas Baker},\index{Thomas Baker (ship)} for instance, was a coal-hauling ship.\cite{MorningAdvertiser} Compared to the three-masted liners, brigs\index{Brigs} were cramped for the number of passengers they carried, with poor ventilation and five-foot ceilings.\cite{OHanlon:33} The voyage from Ireland\index{Ireland} to the United States took anywhere from four to eight weeks.

A larger group of the O'Briens\index{O'Brien!family} arrived in Boston on 27 June 1851 on board the vessel \textit{Chasca}\cite{Chascay:1}.\index{Chasca (ship)} The voyage from Liverpool, England,\index{England!Liverpool} to Boston, Massachusetts,\index{Massachusetts!Boston} took 47 days.\cite{Chascay2:1} On board were Edward\textsuperscript{2} O'Brien\index{O'Brien!Edward/Edmund\textsuperscript{2}} (appearing as Edmund\footnote{Edward is also named as Edmund in daughter Mary Ann O'Brien's birth record. By the time his second child Ellen was born, he was going by Edward.}), his father William,\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} wife Bridget\index{Linehan/Linnehan!Bridget}\index{O'Brien!Bridget (Linnehan)}, sister Abby\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien) Dooley,\index{O'Brien!Abigail\textsuperscript{2}}\index{Dooley!Abigail\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)} and Abby's two children, Margaret\textsuperscript{3}\index{Dooley!Margaret\textsuperscript{3}}\index{Fernald!Margaret\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley) (Simonds)}\index{Simonds!Margaret\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley)} and Hanora\textsuperscript{3} (aka Hannah).\index{Dooley!Hannah/Hanora\textsuperscript{3}}\index{Cooney!Hannah/Hanora\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley)}\index{Cusick!Hannah/Hanora\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley) (Cooney)} There were a total of 256 passengers on board,\cite{Chascay:2} which must have made the ship quite crowded. The \textit{Chasca}\index{Chasca (ship)} was a 658-ton clipper bark\index{clipper barque/bark} built in East Boston\index{Massachusetts!Boston!East Boston} as a speedy cargo ship\cite{ChascaCard,Chascay:3} Like the \textit{Thomas Baker}\index{Thomas Baker (ship)}, it was probably retrofitted to carry passengers in response to the large demand for transport to the New World during the famine\index{famine} years.

Both Abby's\index{Dooley!Abigail\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)}\index{O'Brien!Abigail\textsuperscript{2}} and Margaret's\index{Dooley!Margaret\textsuperscript{3}}\index{Fernald!Margaret\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley) (Simonds)}\index{Simonds!Margaret\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley)} occupations are listed as ``Servt.''\index{servant} in the passenger manifest.\cite{Chascay:4} About 2,000 Irish women\index{Irish-Americans} in Boston\index{Massachusetts!Boston} were domestic workers\index{Domestic workers} in 1850. It was a popular trade for Irish\index{Irish-Americans} immigrant women since they spoke English and didn't have many other opportunities for work available to them.\cite{Ryan:41}

William's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} remaining two children, John\textsuperscript{2}\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}} and Ann\textsuperscript{2},\index{O'Brien!Ann\textsuperscript{2}}\index{Dailey!Ann\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)} made separate voyages from Ireland\index{Ireland} to Boston\index{Massachusetts!Boston} but cannot be found in passenger records. John\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}} must have arrived sometime prior to his marriage in 1853.\cite{John2OBrienCivilMarriage:1} Ann\index{O'Brien!Ann\textsuperscript{2}}\index{Dailey!Ann\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)} may not have arrived until 1870--1880 as she doesn't appear in any prior records.\cite{Census1880Edward:1} 

Like other Irish\index{Irish-Americans} immigrants from this time period, William O'Brien\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} and his children likely came to America to escape the famine\index{famine} and build a better life. While the family may have avoided starvation in Ireland,\index{Ireland} the first few years in Boston\index{Massachusetts!Boston} presented new challenges. The O'Briens\index{O'Brien!family} lived in crowded tenement buildings, suffered devastating losses from communicable diseases, and likely faced anti-Catholic\index{Catholicism} discrimination from the city's dominant class of Protestants.\index{Protestantism}\cite{Ryan:61,Quinlan:58}
	
Moving frequently at first, the family lived predominantly in Boston's North End\index{Massachusetts!Boston!North End} neighborhood during the 1850s and 1860s.\cite{NorthEndAddresses} In 1855, half of all residents of the North End\index{Massachusetts!Boston!North End} were Irish.\index{Irish-Americans}\cite{Todisco:29} Landlords had subdivided the North End's old mansions and warehouses into crowded tenement houses for renting to the newly-arrived immigrants.\cite{Goldfeld:102} Many of the tenements were not connected to sewage systems or had defective toilets, leading to high rates of infant mortality and diseases like smallpox, cholera, and tuberculosis.\cite{Goldfeld:103,Todisco:21,Ryan:48}

In 1834, Irish immigrants\index{Irish-Americans} founded the first Catholic church\index{Catholicism} in Boston's North End\index{Massachusetts!Boston!North End} --- St.\ Mary's of the Sacred Heart,\index{St.\ Mary's of the Sacred Heart (church)} on the corner of Endicott\index{Massachusetts!Boston!Endicott St.} and Cooper Streets.\index{Massachusetts!Boston!Cooper St.}\cite{Todisco:26} John O'Brien\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}} married Mary Mahony\index{Mahoney/Mahony!Mary}\index{O'Brien!Mary (Mahoney)}\index{Bowser!Mary (Mahoney) (O'Brien)} there in 1853.\cite{John2OBrienMarriage:1} St.\ Mary's\index{St.\ Mary's of the Sacred Heart (church)} quickly reached capacity, and so in 1843, St.\ John the Baptist Church\index{St.\ John the Baptist (church)} was founded in a converted pork storehouse on Moon St.\index{Massachusetts!Boston!Moon St.}\cite{Goldfeld:101,Sullivan:128:1} John's children Mary\textsuperscript{3}\index{O'Brien!Mary\textsuperscript{3} (1856--1883)} and Ellen\textsuperscript{3}\index{O'Brien!Ellen/Nellie\textsuperscript{3} (1859--1882)} were baptized there. St.\ John's,\index{St. John the Baptist (church)} too, became crowded, which in 1862 lead to the Catholics\index{Catholicism} purchasing the New North Church\index{New North Church} at the corner of Hanover\index{Massachusetts!Boston!Hanover St.} and Clark Streets\index{Massachusetts!Boston!Clark St.} and re-dedicating it as St.\ Stephen's.\index{St. Stephen's (church)}\cite{Sullivan:128:2} The O'Brien family\index{O'Brien!family} followed many other Irish\index{Irish-Americans} in moving from St.\ John's\index{St. John the Baptist (church)} to St.\ Stephen's\index{St. Stephen's (church)} when it opened. The O'Briens' baptisms and marriages took place at St.\ Stephen's\index{St. Stephen's (church)} at least until Margaret Dooley's\index{Dooley!Margaret\textsuperscript{3}}\index{Fernald!Margaret\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley) (Simonds)}\index{Simonds!Margaret\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley)} marriage there in 1873.\cite{RobertFernaldMarriage:1}

Irish\index{Irish-Americans} immigrants to Boston\index{Massachusetts!Boston} had difficulty finding steady work, given that they were mostly rural farmers\index{farming} and did not have specialized trade skills.\cite{Ryan:21} Many of them started out by opening a grocery\index{grocer} store in their tenement house or somewhere close by.\cite{Ryan:83} Indeed, John's\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}} occupation is listed as ``grocer''\index{grocer} on his son John Joseph's\index{O'Brien!John Joseph\textsuperscript{3} (1861--1938)} birth record.\cite{John3OBrienBirth:1} 

John\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}} and his brother Michael\index{O'Brien!Michael\textsuperscript{2}} both worked as oystermen.\index{oyster harvesting}\cite{EdwardFrancis3OBrienBirth:1,Michael2OBrien1886:1,1861John2OBrien:1} Before the advent of industrial-scale dredging operations, the traditional method of oyster harvesting\index{oyster harvesting} used tongs. Oyster tongs consisted of a pair of metal rakes at the end of long wooden shafts. The oysterman\index{oyster harvesting} would use the tongs to scrape oysters off the bottom of the sea bed and manually haul them onto the boat, up to 70 pounds at a time. The boats were small vessels rigged with one or two sails.\cite{Botwick:95} Being an oysterman\index{oyster harvesting} brought a degree of independence for an unskilled laborer. He typically owned his own boat and tackle, shucked the oysters at home to sell locally, and kept all the profits.\cite{MacKenzie:7:1, Botwick:96} This changed beginning in the 1870s when steam-powered oyster dredging ships arrived, and packing houses took over the oyster shucking process.\cite{MacKenzie:5, MacKenzie:7:2} 

The natural oyster beds in the Charles and Mystic Rivers had long been depleted by the time the O'Briens arrived in Boston. Even the oysters around Cape Cod and Rhode Island were diminishing. The Boston oyster dealers replaced the naturally-growing oysters with seed oysters from Long Island Sound and New Jersey at first, and eventually from Virginia, ``planting'' them in the spring and then harvesting the fully-grown oysters in the fall and winter. Ships would bring the oysters into Boston from Wellfleet on Cape Cod, or other planted beds in Narragansett and Buzzard's Bays. Sailors unloaded the oysters at the docks near Fanueil Hall and sold them to local dealers and peddlers.\cite{Ingersoll:27-28} 

Oyster shuckers worked seasonally from September to May. It was a difficult, low-paying job. In 1880 they were paid between 17 and 20 cents per gallon of oysters shucked. Steamships began bringing twice-weekly shipments of opened oysters to Boston from Norfolk, Virginia, making it more difficult to find local employment in the oyster trade.\cite{Ingersoll:30}

It seems that Edward\index{O'Brien!Edward/Edmund\textsuperscript{2}} was the main provider for the O'Brien family\index{O'Brien!family} during the early years in Boston.\index{Massachusetts!Boston} He may have had a successful trade in Ireland\index{Ireland} prior to his arrival in the United States. In 1855 he was housing his father and his sister Abby's\index{Dooley!Abigail\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)}\index{O'Brien!Abigail\textsuperscript{2}} family in addition to his own.\cite{Census1855William:1} Edward\index{O'Brien!Edward/Edmund\textsuperscript{2}} purchased a 2-person cemetery plot at North Cambridge Catholic Cemetery\index{North Cambridge Catholic Cemetery} in 1852\cite{CarolGordon:1} and a large 13-person plot at Holy Cross Cemetery\index{Holy Cross Cemetery} in 1880\cite{HolyCrossPlotEdward:1} where many of his family members were buried.

In the early 1870s, most of William's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} adult children (Edward,\index{O'Brien!Edward/Edmund\textsuperscript{2}} Ann,\index{O'Brien!Ann\textsuperscript{2}}\index{Dailey!Ann\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)} Mary,\index{O'Brien!Mary\textsuperscript{2}}\index{Ward!Mary\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien)} and Michael\index{O'Brien!Michael\textsuperscript{2}}) relocated to East Boston.\index{Massachusetts!Boston!East Boston} John's\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}} sons, John Joseph\textsuperscript{3},\index{O'Brien!John Joseph\textsuperscript{3} (1861--1938)} James Edward\textsuperscript{3},\index{O'Brien!James Edward\textsuperscript{3}} and William\textsuperscript{3},\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{3}} moved to Boston's South Cove\index{Massachusetts!Boston!South Cove} neighborhood (now part of Chinatown\index{Massachusetts!Boston!Chinatown}).\cite{1870sAddresses}

John's\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}} family was hit particularly hard by tuberculosis.\index{tuberculosis}\index{phthisis|see{tuberculosis}}\index{consumption|see {tuberculosis}}\footnote{The terms ``phthisis'' and ``consumption'' were used at the time to describe what is now called tuberculosis.\cite{TuberculosisHistory}} Four of his children died of the disease between 1879 and 1889, as did John\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}} himself in 1863.\cite{John2OBrienDeath:1} In fact, John's line would have ended if not for his son John Joseph.\index{O'Brien!John Joseph\textsuperscript{3} (1861--1938)} Tuberculosis\index{tuberculosis} disproportionately affected Irish immigrants\index{Irish-Americans} in Boston:\index{Massachusetts!Boston}

\begin{quote}
	\ldots[t]he death rate from consumption\index{tuberculosis} was greatest among the colored, and among the white \ldots it was greatest among those whose mothers were born in Ireland\index{Ireland}\index{Irish-Americans} or who were themselves natives of Ireland, being more than 3 times the corresponding rate for those whose mothers were born in the United States, and almost double the rate for those who were themselves natives of this country.\cite{VitalStatistics}
\end{quote}

Three of Michael's\index{O'Brien!Michael\textsuperscript{2}} sons had jobs working in Boston's\index{Massachusetts!Boston} gas industry.\index{gas industry} Their roles included gas meter maker, meter tester, meter reader, and foreman. The Boston Gas Company\index{Boston Gas Company} constructed a large coal gas plant at Commercial Point\index{Massachusetts!Boston!Commercial Point} in 1882. The company needed to hire a large number of unskilled laborers, and many of them were Irish\index{Irish-Americans} immigrants.\cite{Keating:11} In the early 20th century, these jobs were highly valued, as the company (later called Boston Consolidated Gas)\index{Boston Consolidated Gas} offered employee profit-sharing plans in 1906 and a pension plan in 1919. This provided job stability and wealth for the Irish\index{Irish-Americans} working class.\cite{Keating:20}
