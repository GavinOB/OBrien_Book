	In the 1855 Massachusetts state census, William Simonds and Margaret Dooley were living with their respective families. In 1860, William and Margaret's first child was born (Catharine Simonds). No marriage record can be found in Massachusetts. Another possibility is that they were married in Ireland prior to arriving in the U.S., although Margaret would have been only 15 years old or younger.
