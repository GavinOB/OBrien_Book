		From Mary's obituary: ``She was raised in Boston, graduated from Notre Dame Academy in Roxbury in 1938, Emmanuel College in Boston Class of 1942 and received her Master's in education from Boston College in 1957. Miss O'Brien worked as a school teacher 45 years. Mary taught school for the Archdiocese of Boston from 1942-1973 and then in Boston Public Schools and St. Mary's School in Lynn from 1973 to 1987.''\cite{Mary4OBrienDeath} For a time (probably coinciding with her teaching for the Archdiocese), Mary was known as ``Sr.\ Beatrice Marie, S.N.D.,'' being a Sister of Notre Dame de Namur. \cite{Epilogue,MaryGillDeath} Mary's obituary requested contributions to the Sisters in Everett, Mass.\cite{Mary4OBrienDeath}
