\section{Edward O'Brien}

\MainPerson{Edward\textsuperscript{2} O'Brien} (\Lineage{1}{William}) was born in Watergrasshill, County Cork, Ireland, on 10 October 1822.\cite{Edward2OBrienNaturalization} He died in Boston, Massachusetts, on 25 August 1881\cite{Edward2OBrienDeath} and is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery, Malden, Middlesex County, Massachusetts.\cite{CarolGordon}. He married \MainPerson{Bridget Linnehan}, probably in County Cork, Ireland, sometime before immigrating to the U.S. in June  1851.\cite{Edward2OBrienNaturalization,Edward2OBrienMarriage} Bridget was born in Ireland about 1831, the daughter of Andrew Linnehan and Ann (\_\_\_\_\_) Linnehan. She died in Boston, Massachusetts, on 5 April 1867 of pneumonia at the age of 36.\cite{BridgetLinnehanDeath}

Edward's profession is listed as ``teamster.''\cite{LondonStDeed,Edward2OBrien1876} Prior to the use of motorized vehicles, this term referred to a person paid to transport goods by horse-drawn wagon.\cite{Teamster}

Edward lived at first in Boston's Roxbury\cite{MaryAnn3OBrienBirth} and North End\cite{Edward3OBrienBirth} neighborhoods. In 1870 he paid \$3,000 for the property at 185 London St.\ in East Boston.\cite{LondonStDeed,LondonStMap} Edward acquired a second East Boston property in 1874, when he purchased 307 Havre St.\ for \$3,325 at public auction.\cite{HavrePurchase,HavreMap} Both properties were passed onto Edward's heirs upon his death, although the combined value was only \$3,700 at that time.\cite{Edward2OBrienProbate} His heirs still held title to the properties until at least 1922,\cite{Bromley1922} when the 185 London St.\ property was being rented out as apartments.\cite{GlobeRobbery} Edward's niece, \MainPerson{Frances Elizabeth\textsuperscript{3} (O'Brien) Wickens}, lived there for a time.\cite{Frances3OBrien1914} Edward's daughters, Annie M.\ and Margaret, continued to live at the house on 307 Havre Street up until their deaths in the 1930s.\cite{AnnMaria3OBrienDeath,Margaret3OBrienDeath} The properties were likely important sources of wealth for multiple generations of the O'Brien family.

Living with Edward in 1880 were his adult children Annie, Margaret, and Edward J., his sister Ann\textsuperscript{2} (O'Brien) Dailey, and niece Delia J.\ Graham, the daughter of Bridget's sister Mary. Edward's household also included Michael Malanny, age 65, and his wife Ann, age 62, although their connection to Edward is not known.\cite{Census1880Edward} None of Edward's children ever married. 

There is a large monument at Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden marking where Edward is buried along with his wife Bridget, sister Ann, three of his children, and several extended family members. The plot is located at North Monument Ave., Path 17, Grave 34 East (see map in the appendix).\cite{Edward2OBrienGrave,CarolGordon}
