		Very few records are available for Ellen. Her most likely date of birth was 16 July 1857, parents listed as Michael and Bridget, address at 30 Ferry St.\ in Boston.\cite{Ellen3OBrien2Birth} This corresponds with a baptismal record at St.\ John the Baptist Church in Boston on 18 July 1857, parents Michael O'Brien and Bridget Colman.\cite{Ellen3OBrien2Baptism} ``Colman'' could be a misspelling of ``Colbert.'' Ferry St.\ and St.\ John the Baptist Church place the family near Michael's other siblings in Boston's North End neighborhood.\cite{Boston1861Map}
		
		No plausible marriage or death records for Ellen have been found. She was alive as of 1891 as she appears on the list of father Michael's heirs in his probate file.\cite{Michael2OBrienProbate}
