\section{John O'Brien}

\MainPerson{John\textsuperscript{2} O'Brien}\index{O'Brien!John\textsuperscript{2}}  (\Lineage{1}{William}) was born probably in Watergrasshill, County Cork, Ireland, about 1820.\cite{John2OBrienMarriage} He died in Boston, Massachusetts on 22 April 1863 of ``phthisis'' \cite{John2OBrienDeath} and is buried in Catholic Mt. Auburn Cemetery, Watertown, Massachusetts.\cite{BillMcEvoy} He married \MainPerson{Mary Mahoney} on 20 November 1853 at St.\ Mary's Church, Boston.\cite{John2OBrienMarriage} She was born in Ireland about 1829--1832 to James or Patrick Mahoney and Mary (\_\_\_\_\_)  Mahoney.\cite{John2OBrienCivilMarriage,MaryMahoneyBowserMarriage} After John's death, Mary married Thomas Bowser in 1867.\cite{MaryMahoneyBowserMarriage} Mary died in Somerville, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, on 18 November 1894 of ``apoplexy.''\cite{MaryMahoneyDeath} Mary and Thomas Bowser are buried with John O'Brien in Catholic Mt. Auburn Cemetery.\cite{BillMcEvoy}

John arrived in the U.S.\ sometime prior to his marriage to Mary Mahoney in November 1853. He appears in the 1860 federal census in Boston's North End neighborhood, living with wife Mary and four children. Also living with the family was Amelia Rease, age 19, born in Pico W.\ P.\ \cite{Census1860John} (this is probably Pico Island in the Portuguese Azores). 

John was living at 35 Fleet Street in the North End when his son John Joseph was born in 1861. His occupation was listed as ``grocer''\cite{John3OBrienBirth,Wards} and ``oysterman.''\cite{1861John2OBrien} John's brother Edward probably lived next door at 33 Fleet St.,\cite{1861EdwardOBrien} and his son Edward was born at John's address just nine weeks after John's son John Joseph was born there.\cite{John3OBrienBirth}
