\chapter{The O'Briens in Ireland}

The family of William O'Brien\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} and Mary Sexton\index{Sexton!Mary\textsuperscript{1}}\index{O'Brien!Mary\textsuperscript{1} (Sexton)} came to America from the town of Watergrasshill\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} in County Cork, Ireland.\index{Ireland!County Cork}\cite{Edward2OBrienNaturalization:1} The village is situated mostly within the civil parish of Ardnageehy\index{Ireland!Ardnageehy, County Cork|see{Watergrasshill, County Cork}} and partly within Kilquane,\index{Ireland!Kilquane, County Cork} in the larger barony of Barrymore,\index{Ireland!Barrymore (Barony), County Cork} on the main road between Cork\index{Ireland!Cork (city)} and Dublin.\index{Ireland!Dublin}\cite{TopographicalDictionary} The name Watergrasshill\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} was originally ``Watercress Hill,'' and in Irish is \textit{Cnoc\'{a}n-na-biolraighe} (Knockaun-na-billery).\cite{LocalNames}

Watergrasshill\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} was a small town of 801 inhabitants in 1841, when William\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} and his family lived there prior to their emigration to the U.S. By 1871 the population had dropped to 143.\cite{Population} Some of this population loss was likely due to the famine,\index{famine} but the arrival of the railroad\index{railroad} may also have played a role. 

The Great Southern and Western Railway\index{Great Southern and Western Railway, The}\index{railroad} reached the City of Cork\index{Ireland!Cork (city)} in 1849.\cite{Bianconi:1} The rail bypassed Watergrasshill and replaced the coach traffic that the town relied on for its business. Two people performing land valuations included their impressions of Watergrasshill\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} and its transformation. D.\ Quinn\index{Quinn!D.} wrote in Feb 1849:

\begin{quote}
	This Town is Poor, but a great deal is done in the way of ``Carmen's Stages,'' it being on the Dublin\index{Ireland!Dublin} line to Cork\index{Ireland!Cork (city)} and half way (11 miles) from the latter City to Fermoy\index{Ireland!Fermoy, County Cork} -- a good deal of benefit is done the Town by these persons ---\cite{HouseIntro:1}
\end{quote}

J.\ Montgomery\index{Montgomery!J.} wrote in Dec 1852 and sometime prior:

\begin{quote}
	2 coaches \& Bianconis\footnote{Charles Bianconi\index{Bianconi!Charles} was an Italian entrepreneur who operated passenger coaches between cities throughout Ireland.} can pass through the village daily \& change Horses here -- one or two individuals are thus making pretty well by this -- by the rent for stabling \&c -- \& when the railway to Cork\index{Ireland!Cork (city)}\index{railroad} is finished, it will lose a good part of this advantage ---
	
	It has lost a great deal of it now -- (1852) but it is the best of the little villages in this neighborhood although poor enough -- Poor Rates are low -- only 1/7th for 1832 \& none at all in 1837 -- Those made a moderate val\textsuperscript{n}.\ considering these circumstances.\cite{HouseIntro:2}
\end{quote}

There are few Irish records available covering the early 19th century. Civil registration of births, marriages, and deaths didn't fully occur in Ireland\index{Ireland} until 1864.\cite{Grenham:1} Census records\index{Ireland!Census}\index{Census!Ireland} prior to 1901 were mostly lost in a 1922 fire at the Public Records Office.\cite{Grenham:18} 

The Catholic parish of Watergrasshill has baptismal records beginning in 1836 and marriages from 1864.\cite{ParishRecords} There is a baptismal record for William's granddaughter, Margaret Dooley,\index{Dooley!Margaret\textsuperscript{3}}\index{Simonds!Margaret\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley)}\index{Fernald!Margaret\textsuperscript{3} (Dooley) (Simonds)} in 1840 (Figure \ref{fig:DooleyBaptism}). This is the only definitive Irish record found for William's family.\cite{Margaret3DooleyBaptism2}

There are, however, O'Briens in Watergrasshill\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} who appear in land valuation records from the time period when William's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} family lived in the area. It's possible that these sources may reveal some small details about the family's life in Ireland.\index{Ireland}

There is a ``W\textsuperscript{m}.\ Brien'' listed in the town of Watergrasshill\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} who was leasing a house with a yard and garden.\cite{Valuation1849:1} The Feb 1849 revision has William's name crossed out and the word ``Vact.''\ written, indicating that the house was vacant and William had moved away.\cite{House1849} See William O'Brien's profile for more details about the available records.

There are no other William O'Briens or similar name variants listed in Watergrasshill,\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} although other O'Briens in town include Denis,\index{O'Brien!Denis} Owen,\index{O'Brien!Owen} Patrick,\index{O'Brien!Patrick} and Margaret.\index{O'Brien!Margaret}\cite{Valuation1849:2}

The final version of Griffith's Valuation,\index{Griffith's Valuation} published in 1853, shows only Owen O'Bri\-en\index{O'Brien!Owen} and Patrick O'Bri\-en\index{O'Brien!Patrick} remaining in Watergrasshill.\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork}\cite{Griffiths:46} By 1901 it appears that all O'Bri\-ens had left Watergrasshill,\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} as none are listed in the 1901 or 1911 census.\index{Ireland!Census}\index{Census!Ireland}\cite{1901IrishCensus}

The departure of the O'Brien family\index{O'Brien!family} from Ireland\index{Ireland} corresponded with the ending years of the Irish potato famine,\index{famine} also known as the Great Famine, which lasted from 1845--1849. During this time, there were between 1.5 and 3 million famine-related deaths in Ireland and 1 million people left Ireland for North America.\cite{Smith:469}

An excerpt from a Cork newspaper shows the dire conditions in Watergrasshill during the famine. The name ``Brien'' was a written variant of the O'Brien surname,\cite{TimelineReport} so the man this story could very well be a member of William's family.

	``Destitution and sickness are prevailing to an alarming extent in this district. Within the last fortnight a poor man, named \textsc{Brien}, actually lay dead for two days on the same bed, or rather on the same mop of straw, with his wife and children, who were too ill to aid in his removal. One of the children died last week. On visiting the hovel, a few days after the death of the child, the mother and two children were found recovering from fever---the only clothing they possessed was an old ragged cloak---On approaching the door, the mother started up, snatching the cloak from the children to cover herself for the moment. The neighbours were afraid to enter the hut, fearing infection. The Relief Committee have established a Soup Kitchen in the village, and hope to be enabled to open another. The Rev. \textsc{John A.\ Bolster}, Rector of the Parish, and the Curate, the Rev. \textsc{S.\ B.\ Young}, are, also, endeavouring to provide a fund for clothing, and supplying nourishment to the sick. We trust that their benevolent exertions will be generously responded to, not onl\textit{y} by the proprietors and Iandholders of the district, but by others who have ability to aid in this good work. In the Workhouse (Fermoy) during the last week, there were \textit{seventy} deaths, out of about 1,500 inmates.''\cite{FamineRelief}

Watergrasshill\index{Ireland!Watergrasshill, County Cork} was a poor town in the 1840s that was largely sustained by horse travel between Dublin\index{Ireland!Dublin} and Cork.\index{Ireland!Cork (city)} With the loss of that business to the railway\index{railroad} and the effects of the famine,\index{famine} it made sense for the O'Brien family\index{O'Brien!family} to look for new opportunities in America.
