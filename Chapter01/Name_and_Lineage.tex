O'Brien\index{O'Brien!surname} is the Anglicized spelling of the surname \textit{Ua Briain} in Classical Irish, and \textit{\'{O} Briain} in Modern Irish. The \textit{Ua} or \textit{\'{O}} part of the name means a ``grandson'' or generally any descendant of the named person. In this case, O'Brien derives from the first name of Brian Boru\index{Boru!Brian} (born c. 941 and died 23 Apr 1014), High King of Ireland.\index{Ireland} Boru's descendants formed one of the major dynasties in Ireland.\index{Ireland}\cite{BoruHistorical}

Brian Boru\index{Boru!Brian} was born a member of the D\'{a}l gCais clan (Dalcassians).\index{D\'{a}l gCais (clan)}\index{Dalcassians|see{D\'{a}l gCais (clan)}} This clan controlled much of what is now County Clare\index{Ireland!County Clare} in Ireland.\index{Ireland}\cite{BoruEarlyHistory} Due to modern genetic testing, it is possible to determine whether a living person is a descendant of Brian Boru,\index{Boru!Brian} a member of his clan, or an unrelated O'Brien who came from a family that adopted the surname. This is facilitated by the Y-DNA\index{DNA!Y-DNA} testing of Brian Boru's\index{Boru!Brian} living direct descendant, Sir Conor O'Brien,\index{O'Brien!Conor} 18th Baron Ichiquin.\cite{GGI:1}\index{Baron Inchiquin}

Unlike other chromosomes, the Y chromosome\index{DNA!Y-DNA} is passed from father to son without significant recombination. This means that a living man's Y-DNA\index{DNA!Y-DNA} is nearly identical to that of his direct male line ancestor from many generations in the past. While rare, mutations on the Y chromosome do occur. These variations are called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs.\index{DNA!SNPs} It is possible to map groups of people onto branches of a tree based on the SNPs\index{DNA!SNPs} they have in common. These branches are known as haplogroups,\index{DNA!Haplogroups} and they're named after the Y-DNA\index{DNA!Y-DNA} mutation that defines them.\cite{Bettinger}

The Y-DNA\index{DNA!Y-DNA} testing of Sir Conor O'Brien\index{O'Brien!Conor} has revealed that Brian Boru's\index{Boru!Brian} Dalcassian\index{D\'{a}l gCais (clan)} clan and its descendants are located within the R-L226 haplogroup.\index{DNA!R-L226 haplogroup} Furthermore, Brian Boru's\index{Boru!Brian} defining mutation places him and his descendants in the sub-group of R-L226\index{DNA!R-L226 haplogroup} known as FGC5659.\index{DNA!FGC5659 haplogroup} There is another group of non-Dalcassian\index{D\'{a}l gCais (clan)} O'Briens known as the ``Northwest Irish/Lowland Scots'' O'Briens,\index{Northwest Irish/Lowland Scots O'Briens} who are in haplogroup R-M222.\index{DNA!R-M222 haplogroup}\cite{GGI:2}

A Y-DNA\index{DNA!Y-DNA} test of William O'Brien's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} male line\cite{BigY} reveals that there is no relation to either the Dalcassian\index{D\'{a}l gCais (clan)} or Northwest Irish O'Briens.\index{Northwest Irish/Lowland Scots O'Briens} William's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} branch is located within haplogroup R-Y11179.\index{DNA!R-Y11179 haplogroup} This haplogroup does not have ancient Irish origins but can be traced back to the Anglo-Norman\index{Anglo-Normans} family with the surname ``Barry''\index{Barry surname} that occupied large parts of County Cork\index{Ireland!County Cork} subsequent to the English\index{England} invasion of Ireland\index{Ireland} in the 1100s.\cite{BarrymoreDNA:9} More recent research indicates that these Barrys\index{Barry surname} were probably from the Hainaut\index{Belgium!Hainaut} region of what is now Belgium, rather than French Normandy.\index{France!Normandy}\cite{BarrymoreDNA:2-4}

Several websites provide age estimates to determine when William O'Bri\-en's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} line may have split off from the Barry family.\index{Barry surname} The closest match on FamilyTreeDNA (FTDNA)\index{FamilyTreeDNA} is a man with a Barry surname.\index{Barry surname} FTDNA's\index{FamilyTreeDNA} ``TiP Report'' estimates that the Barry\index{Barry surname} match and William O'Brien's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} descendant have a common ancestor within the past 8 generations at 60.41\% likelihood, within 12 generations at 90.11\% likelihood, and within 18 generations at 98.28\% likelihood.\cite{TiP} On the website \textit{YFull},\index{YFull} which allows uploading Y-DNA\index{DNA!Y-DNA} kits for additional analysis, the closest match is the same Barry\index{Barry surname} individual from the previous comparison. YFull\index{YFull} predicts that the two matches have a most recent common ancestor at a median of 425 years ago with 95\% certainty, placing the common ancestor around the year 1600.\cite{YFull}

Somewhere in William O'Brien's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} ancestry, the O'Brien name\index{O'Brien!surname} was assigned to (or adopted by) a man of Barry\index{Barry surname} descent. This is known as a non-paternity event (NPE).\index{non-paternity event (NPE)} It is likely impossible to determine when or how this occurred, as useful records in Ireland\index{Ireland} rarely go back far enough past the early 1800s. However, the Barry\index{Barry surname} family had a major presence in the area where William\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} came from, receiving grants of land in County Cork\index{Ireland!County Cork} from the English\index{England} king and the title Earl of Barrymore.\index{Earl of Barrymore}\cite{BarrymoreDNA:4} More information may arise as additional men submit Y-DNA\index{DNA!Y-DNA} tests and the timeline for the O'Brien/Barry split can be further narrowed. It is also important to note that the Y-DNA\index{DNA!Y-DNA} results only pertain to the direct male line. William's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} descendants still have Irish roots, owing to the Irish spouses of his children. William's\index{O'Brien!William\textsuperscript{1}} own mother is unknown, but it's quite likely she had ancestral Irish origins.
